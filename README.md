A project about characters build.
My idea is to recall character's data from JSON file, but for now...it run like that simple code pushed xD

MONGO DB

If the connection with MongoDB doesn't start, see this link https://baraksaidoff.medium.com/fixing-mongoserverselectionerror-while-connecting-mongodb-with-node-js-213aaf0bf596

For now, if you want create your db on Mongo, you can insert a collection named "characters" and insert the datas about Fischl from this link https://github.com/Kiabus/GenshinImpactProject/blob/main/genshinImpact_firstHtml/file%20json/fischl_0-20.json
