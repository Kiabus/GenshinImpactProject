A project about characters build.
My idea is to recall character's data from JSON file, but for now...it run like that simple code pushed xD

MONGO DB

I used node.js to create a connection for the application

If the connection with MongoDB doesn't start, see this link https://baraksaidoff.medium.com/fixing-mongoserverselectionerror-while-connecting-mongodb-with-node-js-213aaf0bf596

For now, if you want create your db on Mongo, you can insert the collection called "characters" and insert the datas about Fischl from this link https://github.com/Kiabus/GenshinImpactProject/blob/main/genshinImpact_firstHtml/file%20json/fischl_0-20.json
